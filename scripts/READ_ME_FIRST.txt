The xml files which are dumped directly from the camera and the files generated by the xiCamTool(s) are

1) not identical files
2) are not fully Genicam complient, I.e., they don't always parse correctly using Mark Rivers Genican scripts
3) are bit different depending upon with you use the beta level software or the stable level ones.

Steemer Imaging Common Vision Blox Viewer correctly dumps out a reasonably formated xml file. HOWEVER, the files that it
creates generates about half the PV's that the files from the device generate (once you edit/correct the headers). It seems to 
remove things which are really not well supported by the camera - just don't know how it knows/derives this.

So the scripts in this directory are tweaked to try to deal with both formats, and no idea which commands will actually be used.

For the most part, the template file is really the ony difference between the code generated from the same producer of the xml 
file, but you end up with 3 different versions for each camera, so a total of 6 for the whole Area Detector. There is not a single 
xml file which seems to be a superset of features.
